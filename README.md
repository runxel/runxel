### Hi there 👋

> Be the {change|PR|commit|open source repo} you want to see in the world.

🎇 I'm an architect (_like in building_) and designer who writes code.  

🔭 Always looking for job opportunities!  
I have extensive knowledge in [Archicad](https://runxel.xyz/archicad-wiki) and [GDL object creating](https://runxel.xyz/archicad-objects/), as well in [Rhino + Grasshopper](https://runxel.xyz/rhino-secrets/) (including [RhinoCommon](https://github.com/runxel/rhino-scripts)), and robotics.
